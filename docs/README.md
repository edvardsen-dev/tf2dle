docker compose up -d
```

4. Generate prisma client

```
pnpm dlx prisma generate
```

5. Apply prisma migration to your local database

```
pnpm dlx prisma migrate deploy
```

6. Run application

```
pnpm dev
```

## Workflow

1. Create a new branch from main where you can develop your feature in piece. Remember to commit regularly!
2. Create a merge request to main when done. Make sure all workflows pass and wait for approval.
3. When approved, merge and delete the branch.

## Testing

### Prerequisites

Playwright browsers

```
pnpm exec playwright install
```

_**Note:** Make sure the dev server has optimized all the dependencies_

```
pnpm dev
```

Run tests

```ts
// Integration tests
pnpm test:integration

// With trace viewer
pnpm test:integration --trace on

// Specific test file
pnpm test:integration <filename.test.ts>

// Specific test based on name
pnpm test:integration -g "name of test"

// Unit tests
